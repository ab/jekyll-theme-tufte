*tufte-css-jekyll* is a theme based on [*tufte-css*](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css), which in turn implements the design ideas of Edward Tufte in CSS, and [*tufte-jekyll*](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) (but tries to stick more closely to the original tufte-css styles than the latter).

Note that this is a full-width layout. This was accomplished by including ```layout: full-width``` in the YAML front matter for this page, i.e., no sidenotes or marginnotes! 

If you want to know what Tufte style comprises, have a look at the [Tufte CSS](./page/) page.
