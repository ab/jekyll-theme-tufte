*jekyll-theme-tufte* is a Jekyll theme that implements the design ideas of Edward Tufte. It is a gem-packaged adaptation of the classic-style Jekyll theme [*tufte-css-jekyll*](https://github.com/sdruskat/tufte-css-jekyll), which is in turn based on [*tufte-css*](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) (a CSS file providing the Tufte styles), and [*tufte-jekyll*](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) (another Jekyll theme). This theme sticks more faithfully to the original *tufte-css* styles compared to *tufte-jekyll*.

The Tufte style is known for extensive use of sidenotes, which *tufte-css* displays next to a half-width layout.

The page you're reading now is a full-width layout. This was accomplished by including ```layout: full-width``` in the YAML front matter for the page, i.e., no sidenotes or marginnotes!

To read more about the Tufte style and its usage, have a look at the [Tufte CSS](./page/tufte-css) demo page.
