# jekyll-theme-tufte

## *A minimal Jekyll theme based on [tufte-css](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css)*

*jekyll-theme-tufte* is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static website theme  inspired by the text design of Edward
Tufte. It is enabled by [*tufte-css*](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css),
a CSS file providing the Tufte styles.

This is a gem-packaged theme that can be easily installed by including
*jekyll-theme-tufte* in your `Gemfile`.

Large portions of the theme are derived from prior work to bring *tufte-css* to Jekyll, including:

* [*tufte-css-jekyll*](https://github.com/sdruskat/tufte-css-jekyll), a classic-style Jekyll theme
* [*tufte-jekyll*](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll), a classic-style theme with a lot of extra visual stuff added
* [*tufte-pandoc-jekyll*](https://github.com/jez/tufte-pandoc-jekyll), a gem-style theme that uses pandoc under the hood
* [*ET-Jekyll*](https://github.com/bradleytaunt/ET-Jekyll), a classic-style theme that makes a number of CSS changes

This theme is minimalist and tries to stick closely to the original tufte-css styles. As a gem-based theme, it is also easier to install and manage compared to classic style themes. (Classic Jekyll themes are installed by mixing all the files in with your siteâ€™s files, which creates a big mess.)

## Demo page

See the theme in action on the [demo page](https://ab.github.io/jekyll-theme-tufte/).

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'jekyll-theme-tufte'
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-tufte
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it manually with:

    $ gem install jekyll-theme-tufte

## Usage

### Some theme specifics

- The **large site title (and subtitle)** can be switched on/off by setting the value for `header` in `_config.yml` to false.

- The nav menu page order and titles can be configured in the YAML front matter at the top of each page. See [Available Page Layouts](https://ab.github.io/jekyll-theme-tufte/page/layouts) in the demo site for more info.

## Development of the theme

To set up your environment to develop this theme, clone the theme and run `bundle install`.

Themes work much like normal Jekyll sites, so to test changes to the theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve -w` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000/jekyll-theme-tufte/`. This starts a Jekyll server running the theme demo site.

Only files listed in the regex in the gemspec are included in the published theme. Custom directories can be added by editing the regex in `jekyll-theme-tufte.gemspec`.

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
